This is my personal portfolio, showcasing my skills, and education in modern software engineering. It highlights myexpertise in React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and TailwindCSS.
I also made this site live (hence the use of HashRouters instead of BrowserRouter). The workflow file can be viewed in .githubs/workflow
The site includes both the backend and frontend folders. Tailwind.css was used to modularise stylings in each component
